### Click [here][0] for a live preview!

Get recipes for your favorite cocktails. Thanks to [thecocktaildb][8] for providing the API.

This is a **practice project** built with [React][2], [create-react-app][3], [Bootstrap][4],
[material-ui][5] and [axios][6] focusing on improving my existing skill with React context.

 - Project inspired by [React - La Gu√≠a Completa: Hooks Context Redux MERN + 15 Apps][1].
 - You can see the reference project [clicking here][7]

 #### Known bugs
 
  - Search **ignores** ingredient:
    - The API does not support filtering by ingredient and category simultaneously, this is a mistake in the tutorial that I discovered after finishing it.
      Since this is just an exercice I don't plan on fixing it.
